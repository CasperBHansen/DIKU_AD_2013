\noindent A minimum spanning tree $T$ is a is a tree or graph whose edges are
a subset $T \subseteq E$ of a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$, with weight
function $w$, such that the weight of an edge $(u, v) \in E$ is determined by
$w$, and the weight of the tree $T$ is minimized.

The total weight of a graph $T$ is given by the sum of all of its edge weights.
\begin{align}
	w(T) = \sum_{(u, v) \in T}w(u, v)
\end{align}

The term \textit{spanning} refers to the fact that the tree $T$ spans the
entire set of vertices $V$, and the term \textit{minimum} refers to that the
tree $T$ is of minimum weight.

\subsection{Loop Invariant}
We state the loop invariant of algorithm \ref{alg:generic-mst}; prior to each
iteration, $A$ is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.
\\\\
\noindent \textbf{Initialization} \\
After line 3, where we initialize the set $A$ to the empty set, $A$ trivially
satisfies the loop invariant, as the empty set is a subset of any set.
\\\\
\noindent \textbf{Maintenance} \\
Lines 4-7 maintains the loop invariant, because we only add \textit{safe}
edges to $A$. That is, edges $(u, v)$ where $A \cup \{(u, v)\}$ also
satisfies the loop invariant.
\\\\
\noindent \textbf{Termination} \\
Since all edges added to $A$ are in a minimum spanning tree, $A$ must be a
minimum spanning tree of $G$.
