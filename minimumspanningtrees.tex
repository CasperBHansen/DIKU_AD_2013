\noindent A minimum spanning tree $T$ is a is a tree or graph whose edges are
a subset $T \subseteq E$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$, with weight function $w$,
such that the weight of an edge $(u, v) \in E$ is determined by $w$, and the
weight of the tree $T$ is minimized.

The term \textit{spanning} refers to the fact that the tree $T$ spans the
entire set of vertices $V$, and the term \textit{minimum} refers to that the
tree $T$ is of minimum weight.
