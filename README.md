you have been granted permission to alter the code on the repository you can do
one of two things to contribute to the project; read the sections of the
document through as they are added and use the issue-tracker on GitHub to report
inconsistencies or requests for improvement, additions, etc. Or, you can start
writing what you think should go into the document for the good of others.

## How to become a contributor

# FAQ

## Why is it in English?
The document is initially written in English for purposes of redistributing
later for the next students on this course, and others like it. If you want,
you are free to translate the document, but consult the repository owner before
doing so, as we would like to keep the repository structure in good shape, and
so this would have to be discussed before committing those sorts of changes.
