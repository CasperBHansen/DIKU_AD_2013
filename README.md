DIKU Algorithms & Datastructures Disposition
============

A collaborative effort on writing a good disposition for the algorithms and data
structures exam topics.

The course syllabus is quite big and the topics covered can be hard to
understand. The document seeks to present these in a concise manner that is
easily understandable, thereby ensuring everyone stands a good chance of
preparing a good performance during the actual examination.

## I want to help out!
There are several ways for you to help out with this project. After you have
been granted permission to alter the code on the repository you can do one of
two things to contribute to the project; read the sections of the document
through as they are added and use the issue-tracker on GitHub to report
inconsistencies or requests for improvement, additions, etc. Or, you can start
writing what you think should go into the document for the good of others.

### How to become a contributor

* Get a cloned copy of the repository
* Copy/paste one of the authors and replace it with your own information.
* Start writing and commit your contributions, or use the issue-tracker to help.

## Coding Guidelines
As this document is specifically meant as a reference tool for the oral exam,
we would like anything that gets added or revised to be very short, concise and
to-the-point. Keep everything you write relevant to the subject in question and
do not write exhaustively long paragraphs that doesn't help the student during
the preparation time or under the exam itself.

### Document Structure
We have adopted a structure that we believe helps the student refresh the topic
quickly and that ensures no time is spent looking up things in the book, but
rather gives a precise description of what should be talked about during the
topic discussion, what assignments are relevant for the assignment talk, and
possible extra questions.

Each chapter corresponds to an examination topic, and the first page clearly
states the topic, keywords for the topic in question, and what assignments that
are relevant to this topic. Besides these short informational points, the
remainder of the first page gives a short description of the topic to be
discussed, which serves as a quick reminder to the student. Subsequent pages
within a chapter (or exam topic) are carefully thought out subtopics that
should be covered during the examination. These sections should include a
helping hand such that if the student gets stuck or has trouble remembering,
the document will help the student get back up (ie. step-by-step proofs).

The appendix gives the most important definitions and summaries relevant for
most, if not all, of the topics.

## FAQ

### Why is it in English?
The document is initially written in English for purposes of redistributing
later for the next students on this course, and others like it. If you want,
you are free to translate the document, but consult the repository owner before
doing so, as we would like to keep the repository structure in good shape, and
so this would have to be discussed before committing those sorts of changes.
