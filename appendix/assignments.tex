\chapter{Assignments}
\label{appendix:assignments}
In this appendix section we give an overview of the assignments that can be
asked about during the examination.

\section{2-2 Bubblesort}
\label{appendix:assignments|ass:bubblesort}
The takeaway point of this assignment was mainly that of efficiency, and can
thus be related to how the \textit{divide-and-conquer} paradigm optimizes for
better efficiency. It also served as an exercise for proving \textit{loop
invariants} (see appendix \ref{appendix:proofs|sec:loop-invariant}).
